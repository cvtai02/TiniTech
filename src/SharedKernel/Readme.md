### The Shared Kernel is a concept from Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It's used to define a small, explicitly shared set of domain model elements between multiple bounded contexts (or modules) that have tight cooperation and mutual trust.

### In practical terms, it's a shared library or code module containing:

-   Value Objects
-   Enums
-   Base domain events
-   Interfaces or abstractions
-   Utilities tightly related to the domain

* But: It only contains what absolutely must be shared between modules.
